# File Saving Integration TODO

## Overview
Integrate file saving functionality to save files in local storage and potentially Dropbox for the PWA template.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Analysis
- [x] Analyze current project structure and identify integration points
- [x] Review existing PWA manifest and service worker configuration
- [x] Check current state management approach in App.tsx
- [x] Identify where file operations should be integrated

## Phase 2: Local Storage Implementation
- [x] Create storage service module for local storage operations
- [x] Implement save file functionality to browser's localStorage
- [x] Implement load file functionality from localStorage
- [x] Implement clear localStorage functionality
- [x] Add file listing functionality for saved files
- [x] Implement file deletion from localStorage
- [x] Add file size validation and storage quota handling

## Phase 3: Dropbox Integration Setup
- [ ] Set up Dropbox API credentials and configuration
- [ ] Install Dropbox SDK or implement custom API client
- [ ] Create Dropbox authentication service
- [ ] Implement OAuth flow for Dropbox access
- [ ] Handle token storage and refresh logic

## Phase 4: File Service Architecture
- [ ] Create unified file service interface
- [ ] Implement provider pattern for different storage backends
- [ ] Add file format validation and conversion utilities
- [ ] Implement file metadata tracking (name, size, date, provider)
- [ ] Add file conflict resolution (overwrite/rename prompts)

## Phase 5: UI Components
- [x] Create file save dialog component
- [x] Create file load/open dialog component
- [x] Implement file browser/list component
- [x] Add file operation status indicators
- [ ] Create settings panel for storage preferences
- [ ] Add export/import functionality for data portability

## Phase 6: Integration and Features
- [x] Integrate file operations into main App component
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for save/load (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+O)
- [ ] Implement auto-save functionality
- [ ] Add file versioning and backup capabilities
- [ ] Create file sharing options (generate shareable links)
- [x] Add offline support for local storage operations

## Phase 7: Error Handling and Edge Cases
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for all operations
- [ ] Add retry logic for network failures
- [ ] Handle storage quota exceeded scenarios
- [ ] Add user-friendly error messages and recovery options
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Phase 8: Security and Privacy
- [ ] Review and implement data sanitization
- [ ] Add file type restrictions for security
- [ ] Implement user consent for cloud storage
- [ ] Add data encryption for sensitive files
- [ ] Review privacy implications of cloud storage

## Phase 9: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create unit tests for storage services
- [ ] Test file operations across different browsers
- [ ] Validate PWA offline functionality
- [ ] Test Dropbox integration end-to-end
- [ ] Performance testing for large files
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility testing

## Phase 10: Documentation and Polish
- [ ] Update README with new file saving features
- [ ] Add user documentation for file operations
- [ ] Create API documentation for storage services
- [ ] Add inline code comments for complex operations
- [ ] Performance optimization and cleanup

## Success Criteria
- [x] Files can be saved to and loaded from local storage
- [ ] Dropbox integration works with proper authentication
- [x] UI provides intuitive file management experience
- [x] All operations work offline for local storage
- [x] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [x] Performance is acceptable for typical file sizes
- [x] Code follows project conventions and is maintainable

## Notes
- Start with local storage implementation as it's simpler and works offline
- Dropbox integration can be added as an optional premium feature
- Consider implementing a plugin architecture for easy addition of other cloud providers
- Focus on user experience and make file operations as seamless as possible
